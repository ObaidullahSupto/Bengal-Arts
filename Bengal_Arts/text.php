                                                    The Mughal emperor Akbar (ruled 1556â€“1605) ordered his artists to prepare an illustrated copy of the Hamzanama on a scale never seen before: 1,400 paintings on sheets of paper backed with cloth. 
                                                    Literary sources record that though more than fifty painters busied themselves with the colossal undertaking, it took fifteen years to complete.

                                                   His sovereign status is indicated by a row of attendants on his left,
