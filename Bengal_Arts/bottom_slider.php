                                                    The Hamzanama recounts the picturesque exploits of Hamza, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad. 
                                                    The Mughal emperor Akbar (ruled 1556â€“1605) ordered his artists to prepare an illustrated copy of the Hamzanama on a scale never seen before: 1,400 paintings on sheets of paper backed with cloth. 
                                                    Literary sources record that though more than fifty painters busied themselves with the colossal undertaking, it took fifteen years to complete. Four of the folios are held by the Brooklyn Museum.

                                                   This painting depicts the demon Arghan bringing a casket of arms to Hamza. Emerging from the water,
                                                   here rendered by frothy, curling waves, he presents a seemingly ferocious aspect with his spotted skin, flaming eyes,
                                                   and sharp fangs projecting from a mouth with a rather frozen grimace. On the shore is Hamza,
                                                   seated on a throne beneath a bright canopy held up by two poles and ropes.
                                                   His sovereign status is indicated by a row of attendants on his left, 
                                                   carrying such insignia as the yak-tail whisk that is waved over Hamza's head.
